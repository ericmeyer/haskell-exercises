-- When you create datatypes you can use the `deriving` keyword to have Haskell automatically
-- create certain functions for you.
--
-- In the following example, `Eq` lets you compare values with the `==` function.
-- `==`   is needed so that `shouldBe` can compare the expected value to the actual value.
--
-- `Show` defines the `show` function for your datatype, which is the Haskell equivalent of toString.
-- `show` is needed to print incorrect values to the console for failing tests.
--
-- data AnotherType = ConstructAnotherType deriving (Eq, Show)

-- You need to create this data type and the functions that operate on it
